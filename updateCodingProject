I have been working on getting the frame of the code running. Meaning that even if the stock market predictor is not really doing anything, at least it can output what I intended then it works. I am going to start working on hacing the graph work in the output.

I will use the Github repsitory that I forked as reference where it is actually working. I am learning about how to get data from a source and use it well with python coding. 

Looking at the roadmap, I am about 1/3 of the way done, and I plan to have it 2/3 of the way a little after Thanksgiving break.
